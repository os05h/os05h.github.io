        <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

        <p>
            I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the
            second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
        </p>

        <p>
            This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
            checking back and see how my journey is going!
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
            <li>
                I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {
                    identity.occupation
                }.
            </li>
            {
                identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
                    <li>
                        Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
                        {identity.hobbies[1]}
                    </li>
                )
            }
        </ul>
        <p>My skills are:</p>
        <ul>
            {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
        </ul>
        {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
